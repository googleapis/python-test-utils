#################
Python Test Utils
#################

This is a collection of common tools used in system tests of Python client libraries for Google APIs.

We use `nox <https://nox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to instrument our tests. This package is added to each `nox` session as described in each repository's ``noxfile.py``.
